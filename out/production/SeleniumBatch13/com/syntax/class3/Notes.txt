WHY DO WE NEED XPATH AND CSS SELECTOR?
     Developers may not provide all the locators in html.

ADVANTAGES:
     By using xpath ans css we can identify elements with any given attribute.
     We can identify if the element is unique or not.

WHAT IS AN XPATH?
     It is a full address
     Xpath is like a query language which helps us to identify elements unique on the web page.

TYPES OF XPATH: command=f  inside the DOM
  1)Absolute xpath(NO COMMON USED)-->Starts from the starting note of the html
                     It always starts with a single slash  /
                     e.g. /html/body/div/div/div.........so on until you find the element you're looking for.

  2)Relative xpath--> Starts from any note in html
                      It will always starts with double slash(//)

                       Syntax for relative xpath:
                            //tag-name[@attribute = 'attribute value ']
                       e.g. //input[@id= 'email']

        2.1) Identify elements by its text:
        For buttons or texts present in the window
               //tag-name[text() = 'text value']
          e.g. //a[text() = 'Create new account']
          e.g. //h2[text()='Connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook.']

        *2.2) Identify elements by using contains method:
         When you have long attributed values case-sensitive
         also this helps when you have numerical values in id
         you can only put one part without numbers to identify.

             //tag-name[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')
        e.g. //input[contains(@placeholder,'Email')]

        Identify elements by its text, using contains method
        e.g. //h2[contains(text(), 'friends')]

        2.3)starts-with will identify elements by its partial starting value:
            //tag-name[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value')]
        e.g //input[starts-with(@aria-label, 'Email')]

 ends-with was used in xpath 1.0, we are using 2.0 and this method is not available

 ADVANCE XPATH:
 Is based on parent and child, sibling relationships
 identifying elements by the fallowing sibling
 When you don't have any unique attribute to be located

     //tag-name[@attribute = 'attribute value']/fallowing-sibling::tag-name
e.g. //input[@id ='calFromDate']/fallowing-sibling::img
DOESN'T MATTER THE POSITION OF THE SIBLINGS
e.g. //label[@for ='leavelList_calFromDate']/fallowing-sibling::img

IDENTIFY ELEMENTS BY PRECEDING SIBLINGS:
from down-->up sibling identify
     //tag-name[@attribute = 'attribute value']/preceding-sibling::sibling tag-name
     Text we don't use @
e.g. //span[text()='& Orders']/preceding-sibling::span

IDENTIFY ELEMENTS BY ITS PARENT:
//tag-name[@attribute ='attribute value']/parent::parent tag-name
//span[text()='& Orders']/parent::a

IDENTIFY ELEMENTS BY ITS ANCESTORS:
Everything above parent is considered as an ancestor
//input[@id='email']/ancestor::div

RARELY USE BUT HELPFUL->IDENTIFY ELEMENTS BY ITS INDEX(not common)
(//img[@class ='ui-datapicker-trigger'])[2]
