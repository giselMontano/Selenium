SELENIUM CLASS 2

WHAT IS A WEB-ELEMENT?
      Anything we see in the web page is consider to be web elements.
      Such as buttons, names, textboxes(spaces where you can write such as email, password, name,etc),
      checkboxes, links(forgot password).
HTML: HyperText Markup Language

WHAT IS DOM?
 DOM stands for document Objects Model. it is the browser's internal view of the webpage.
 Also called as Developer's tools or dev tools
 Document-->a simple HTML document which represents the page we are inspecting
 Object-->any line in HTML is considered to be an object
 Model-->it is just a layout of the HTML

right chick->select inspect->in order to select an elements you must press the arrow in the corner
and chick on the element from the webpage you want to select and chick on it

Locator
 Identify the address of position of web elements in web page
 is used to locate or identify web elements on the webpage

8 Locators: when one of the locator contains spaces try to find another option
 *ID: if it has numbers try no to use it
 *Name:
 TagName:
 xpath:
 *LinkText:
 *PartialLinkText:
 CssSelectors:
 *ClassName:

 WHY DO WE NEED SO MANY LOCATORS?
    Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
    Some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes, when selenium finds duplicate locators it interacts with the first one that finds
    Some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
  ex. linktext and partialLinktext are only used for links <a

  "<a"tag is also called an anchor tag
  if 2 or more elemets have same attributes and attribute values,
  selenium will only interacts with the first element located.
