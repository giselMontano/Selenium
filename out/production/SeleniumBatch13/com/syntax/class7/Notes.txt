SELENIUM CLASS7

HANDELING MULTIPLE WINDOWS (TABS):
In order to handle multiple windows we will be using:
getWindowHandle()
getWindowHandles()

WindowHandle:
It is a unique ID that holds the address of the window or tab,
It is approximately a 40 alphanumeric character ID

The original page where you navigate will be called "parent handle"
and the additional tab open afterwards will be called "child handle"

Most of the time when you interact with links they will open a new tab or a window
=====================================================================================
SYNCHRONIZATION: Process of bringing two o more component to the same speed level.
in this case we are bringing our script and page load to the saem speed level.

Thread.sleep()-->static wait/unconditional wait

TYPES OF SELENIUM WAITS:
Implicit wait
Explicit wait
Fluent wait

IMPLICIT WAIT: 20 seconds wait if it finds the elements in less time will ignore the rest of the wait time left
It tells the web driver to wait until certain amount of time before throwing an exception/error
it will only be written once and will be applied to the whole session of the execution
We can say the implicit wait  is a global wait.

IMPLICIT wait works with findElement() method

IMPLICIT WAIT is usually set for 20 sec. If your element is found in any time between the given time the
remaining time will be ignored and your script will move on to the next line or to the next step.
If the element is not found in the given time, ONLY then you will get an exception.
