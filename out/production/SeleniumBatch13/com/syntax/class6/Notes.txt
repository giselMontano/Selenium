SELENIUM CLASS 6

ALERTS:
Alert is a pop ups message. Alerts take a complete focus of our main page that we are on.
We cannot proceed further until it is handled//blocks access till solve it

3 TYPES OF ALERTS:
1.* Web Based alerts/ HTML Alerts - we can simply inspect and perform needed actions, pop ups that happen in the web page
2.* Javascript Alert/ browser alert - we can handle these alerts by using "switchTo method"
                                     we cannot inspect//browser pop ups that take completely control from our main page and its not a web element.
3. windows based alerts - we cannot handle with Selenium - not windows OS, it is a pop up window
this window based alerts show up when you try to choose a file from your own system example the pop ups to uploading pictures, or uploading documents.
Part of the operator system in your computer, desktop application.

TYPES OF JAVASCRIPT ALERTS:
        1. simple alert - click ok, only one option
        2. confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok, two options
        3. prompt alert - enter the text and then click ok or cancel,text and two options

TO HANDLE JAVASCRIPT ALERTS WE ONLY HAVE 4 METHODS:
1. accept() -> click ok
2. dismiss() ->click on cancel
3. getText() ->get the message from the message as a string//from alert interface  for pop-ups alerts and from web-elements interface when it is for a frame
4. sendKeys()
===============================================================================================
FRAMES
//iframe ->will tell you how many frames do you have in the window
html document

Frame is a separate and independent window in our webpage
Frames allow devs to represent multiple different views on one page


3 WAYS TO INTERACT OR TO SWITCH FOCUS TO A FRAME:
1. by index
2. by name or id
3. by web-element

in alerts - switch focus to an alert manually and switch back focus to main html automatically
in frames - switch focus to frame manually and switch back focus to the main page manually
