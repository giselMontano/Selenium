IMPLICIT WAIT: GLOBAL WAIT.
Wait fore some amount of time before throwing an exception, it needs to find an element within that time frame.
once found it, it goes to the rest of the code.
usually set for 20 sec

Will be applied for find element() methods

EXPLICIT WAIT OR WEB-DRIVER WAIT: WAIT FOR CERTAIN CONDITIONS one for each condition.
Wait for condition to be met.
Is used to tell the web-driver to wait for a certain condition
before throwing an exception for a specific condition.

Explicit wait works with "ExpectedCondition class" from selenium that waits until
a certain condition is met or the given time is achieved.

FLUENT WAIT -- GLOBAL WAIT-->outdated
It is used to tell the web-driver to wait for certain condition as well as its frequency before throwing an exception

IMPLICIT WAIT=> We wait to locate the elements
EXPLICIT WAIT=> Wait until certain condition is met
FLUENT WAIT=> We set timeout, and pulltime and ignore needed exceptions in the give time period
