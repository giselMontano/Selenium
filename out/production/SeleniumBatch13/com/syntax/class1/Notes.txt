get(); vs navigate();
           navigate(); gives us more option back forwards and refresh the page.
           get(); WAITS for the page to fully load whereas navigate(); WILL NOT wait for this.
           get(); WILL NOT keep the history of the browser whereas navigate(); WILL//history bar

close(); vs quit();
           close (); close the current tab
           quit(); close the whole browser

fullscreen();  vs maximize();
           maximize(); will maximize the browser and you will be able to se the control panel(back, forward, bookmarks,url tab)
           fullscreen() will maximize the whole web page
