CALENDARS
Calendar are also called as date=pickers

HOW TO HANDLE CALENDAR:
1) Click on the calendar
2) Locate the month and get text
3) Loop(click next) with "while loop" until we find the desire text and keep updating moth text
4) As soon as we find our desire text-->grab all the cells from the table
5) Loop through the cells
6) once the cell value is matched with our condition-->click on the matched date
