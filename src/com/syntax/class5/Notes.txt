SELENIUM CLASS 5

checkboxes: Can be check multiples boxes
radiobutton: Can be chosen only one option

"WEB ELEMENTS" HELPS US TO STORE DATA
WHEN WE NEED TO CHECK MORE THAN ONE CHECKBOX OR RADIOBUTTON.

Link list--> better in manipulating the data.
Arraylist--> better at reading the data from it.

HANDLING CHECKBOXES AND RADIOBUTTON:
-- if you only have 1 checkbox or 1 radiobutton -- you can just click on it
-- if you have multiple choices - store them in a List and loop through

DROPDOWNS:
DropDowns is a menu which gives us an opportunity to select one or more options

TYPES OF DROPDOWNS:
1. Single Select->We can only select one value example age, month, year.//note! we can not deselect the single option, only on multiple select
2. Multiple Select->We can select more than one option.

HANDLING DROPDOWNS:
1. click on dropdowns then click on option
2. using "Select Class"<-class in selenium
                in order to use Select Class
                we need to make sure our dropdown has
                a <Select tag.

SELECTING AN OPTION FROM A DROPDOWN CAN BE DONE IN 3 WAYS:
1. by index
2. by visible text
3. by value

Whenever you interact with multiple elements you store them inside
the container such as List, Set etc..

In order to deselect the option from dropdown
-- Make sure your DropDown is multiple select with--> boolean isMultiple = here.isMultiple();
deselectByValue()
deselectByIndex()
deselectByVisibleText()
deselectAll()
